### What is Solana Suite

Solana client SDK for inexperienced users, developed in Github with OSS and
published as an NPM module. It is a function-driven, all-in-one package of
libraries necessary for Web3 services, with original functions not found in
other libraries and the ability to do what you want to do with a single
function. It is also cost conscious and developed with a Solana-friendly
concept.
